   and Metabolism is hosting the 19th ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies Congress 2017 (AFES2017). It will be held from

   endocrinology with a good blend of international and ASEAN perspectives delivered by many prominent speakers from various
   parts of the world. The congress will be another major step forward in the field of endocrinology by encouraging more
